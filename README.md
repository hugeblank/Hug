# Hug
Advanced ComputerCraft shell, including a package manager, advanced autocompletion and a login system. For more info, see [this](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/29017-hug-the-advanced-extended-shell-bag-included/).

The general plan for hug is to get it to the level of a proper linux CLI. While I am unsure if this is at all feasible, I will make an attempt to get there. 

This code is completely open source, feel free to manipulate it as you desire.

Lastly: 
 - If you see something fit for the vanilla hug shell, please make a PR. 
 - If you spot a bug in the current system please report it as an issue.
